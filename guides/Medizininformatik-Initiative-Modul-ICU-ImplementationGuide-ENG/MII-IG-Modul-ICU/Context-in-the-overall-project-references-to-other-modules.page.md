The intensive care extension module is part of the core data set (KDS) of the Medical Informatics Initiative (MII).

The special significance from the perspective of the Medical Informatics Initiative lies in the severity of the patient's illness, the fine-grained data collection in special documentation systems and the comparatively high density of fully and partially structured data. Furthermore, intensive care data is of great importance in the context of the pandemic. This applies both to local and national pandemic management and to COVID-19 and pandemic-related research.

### References to other modules

Acute medicine generates a large amount of data that is covered by other modules. This applies in particular to

* Medication (including volatile and gaseous medication as well as parenteral medication with individual preparations of infusion solutions from basic components and time-variable run rates; weight- and body-surface-adapted dosages)

* Case data (intensive care unit yes/no, complex intensive care treatment yes/no, movement data)

* Diagnoses (including working, progression, exclusion, suspected diagnoses and complications with time stamp)

* Procedures (procedures also independent of liquidation, including start and end time if applicable)

* Laboratory findings - including virology, immunology, point of care diagnostics such as blood gas analysis values (BGA) or activated clotting time (POCT-ACT) â€“ these including body temperature, sampling type and inspiratory oxygen fraction, if applicable - and finally transfusion medicine

* Structural data (structural data on the facility - including number of employees (incl. qualifications), recording of quality indicators)
