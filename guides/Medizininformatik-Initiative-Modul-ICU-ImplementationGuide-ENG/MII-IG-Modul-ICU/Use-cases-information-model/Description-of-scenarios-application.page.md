### Application scenario in productive use:
#### National Covid-19-Dashboard
[Tooling](https://github.com/mwtek/dashboarddataprocessor) is already available for the [national Covid-19-dashboard](https://coronadashboard.ukbonn.de/) (a project of the University Medicine Network and the Medical Informatics Initiative), which evaluates and displays the level of care (normal ward, intensive care unit, intensive care unit with ventilation, intensive care unit with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) of SARS-CoV-2 patients using the profiles on ventilation and extracorporeal procedures contained in the intensive care extension module.

### Work in progress application scenario:
#### Algorithmic Surveillance in Intensive Care

The [ASIC-app]( https://www.medizininformatik-initiative.de/de/asic-algorithmische-ueberwachung-der-intensivversorgung) uses intensive care data (ventilation duration, Horovitz quotient, end-expiratory ventilation pressure) for the early detection and guideline-compliant treatment of acute respiratory failure. When developing the interoperable interfaces between the patient data management systems and the backend of the app, the corresponding profiles of the intensive care extension module will increasingly be used.
